# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Preparing for the "Silver tsunami"
In this project, I assisted Pewlett-Hackard in identifying all of the upcoming employees eligible for retirement as well as employees who could mentor greener employees to help fill their spots as they leave.

## The Breakdown
I started off by creating a conceptual diagram with the table names and column headers based off the CSV files I was provided.

This was a great blueprint to have to start writing my schema for SQL. Once my tables were created. I began to join and filter tables to get more detailed information about retiring employees.

Once all of the filters are set and organized, our data shows that out of our 300,000 employees 72,458 will be retiring with in the next few years.

Pewlett-Hackard wants to look into a metorship program to train up eligible employees to fill the spots of the retiring employees. They want employees that have roughly 10 more years before retirement.

This gives them 1,549 employees to partake in the mentor program.

This gives them a small amount of employees to fill Senior positions, but they are still going to have a lot of job openings if they only use this pool of employees.

## Highlights of the Data
- 72,458 out of roughly 300,000 employees are retiring.
- We filtered the data to build a table of eligible employees for a mentorship program.
- 1,549 employees met the requirements to mentor.
- Some positions could be filled through the program, but a lot of jobs will still be left open.

## Final Thoughts
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    - 72,458 roles

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    - blah blah
If Pewlett-Hackard would expand the eligible employees metor program to include employees born between 1960-1965 and hired between 1990-1999, they would have 42,254 people (14% of current employees) to partake in the program.

This would allow for a much better ratio of metors to trainees in more areas across the board.
